# Part 3-b: Exercises 3.9.-3.11. - Fullstackopen Course

This section is based on the [Fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/deploying_app_to_internet#exercises-3-9-3-11) course.

## 3.10 Phonebook backend step 10

### Deploying the Backend to Render

In this step, I deployed the backend of the Phonebook application to **Render**. The frontend remains local or on another service, but only the backend is deployed.

### Deployment Process

To deploy, I created a separate repository for the backend and followed these steps:

1. **Pushed the backend code** to a new GitHub repository.  
   `https://github.com/OzkrMebasser/phone-book-backend-p-3-fulltstackopen`

2. **Created a new Render service** for a Node.js application.
3. **Connected the repository** to Render and set the build command:
   ```sh
   npm install && npm run build && npm start
   ```
4. **Deployed the backend** successfully.

### Testing the Deployed Backend

Once deployed, I tested the backend using:

- **Browser**: Checked `https://phone-book-backend-p-3-fulltstackopen.onrender.com/api/persons` to ensure it returns the correct JSON response.
- **Postman**: Sent `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and `PUT` requests to verify API functionality.
- **VS Code REST Client**: Ran API requests to confirm everything works as expected.

### Logs and Monitoring

As a **best practice**, I monitored the logs in Render to ensure the backend was running correctly and there were no unexpected errors.

#### Example Log Output in Render

```
Server running on port 3001
GET /api/persons 200
POST /api/persons 201
```

### Updated `README.md`

I also added the **backend deployment link** to my repositoryâ€™s `README.md` for easy access.

#### âœ… Final Result

The backend is now live on **Render**, successfully serving requests from the internet. Here are some screenshots of the logs and my API tests in **Postman**:

`GET` method, show all persons

## 3.11: Full Stack Phonebook

In this exercise, I generated a **production build** of the frontend and added it to the backend using **Express**. I also deployed the full-stack application on **Render**.

### Steps Followed:

1. **Build the Frontend**  
   In the frontend project directory, I ran:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This created a `dist` directory containing the production build.

2. **Serve the Frontend with Express**  
   In the backend, I modified `index.js` to serve the frontend:

   ```javascript
   // Serve the frontend from the 'dist' folder
   app.use(express.static("dist"));
   ```

3. **Ensure `dist` is Committed**  
   I made sure that `dist/` was **not** in `.gitignore`, so it was included in the deployment:

4. **Deploy the Full-Stack App on Render**  
   I redeployed my backend on **Render**, ensuring that both the frontend and backend worked together.

5. **Verify Local Development**  
   I checked that the frontend still worked in **development mode** by running:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

---

### Expected Behavior

- When accessing the deployed **backend URL**, the full-stack **React frontend** should load properly.
- API routes (`/api/persons`, `/info`, etc.) should still work as expected.
- The application should work both locally and in production.
